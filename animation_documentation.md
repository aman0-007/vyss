# Website Animation Documentation

## Overview
Professional animations have been added to enhance user experience across all pages while maintaining the existing design and functionality.

## Animation Libraries Used
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: For scroll-triggered animations
- **Custom CSS Animations**: For on-load animations and transitions

## Animations Added

### Landing Page (landing.html)
**On-load Animations:**
- Header: Fade-in from top
- Hero section: Scale-in effect for the main content box
- Hero text: Staggered fade-in from bottom with delays
- Buttons: Smooth transitions on hover

**Scroll Animations:**
- About section: Fade-right for text, fade-left for image
- Mission section: Fade-up for title and cards with staggered delays
- Initiatives section: Fade-up cards with staggered timing
- Donation section: Fade-up for content
- Contact form: Fade-up animation
- Footer: Fade-up animation

### Student Dashboard (student_dashboard.html)
**On-load Animations:**
- Sidebar: Fade-in from left
- Main content: Fade-in from right

**Scroll Animations:**
- Welcome message: Fade-up
- Section headers: Fade-up
- Event cards: Fade-up with staggered delays
- Past events grid: Fade-up with staggered timing

### Student Login (student_login.html)
**On-load Animations:**
- Login form container: Scale-in effect
- Logo: Fade-in from bottom
- Title: Fade-in from bottom (0.2s delay)
- Subtitle: Fade-in from bottom (0.3s delay)
- Form: Fade-in from bottom (0.4s delay)

## Animation Settings
- **Duration**: 800ms (standard)
- **Easing**: ease-out for natural feel
- **Trigger**: once (animations play only once)
- **Offset**: 50-100px (animations trigger before element is fully visible)

## Performance Considerations
- Animations are optimized for performance
- Uses CSS transforms and opacity for smooth rendering
- AOS library is lightweight (~13KB)
- Animations trigger only once to prevent performance issues on scroll

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- CSS animations have fallbacks

## Customization
Animation settings can be modified in the AOS initialization:
```javascript
AOS.init({
    duration: 800,        // Animation duration
    easing: 'ease-out',   // Easing function
    once: true,           // Play animation only once
    offset: 100           // Trigger offset
});
```

## Files Modified
1. `landing.html` - Main landing page with comprehensive animations
2. `student/student_dashboard.html` - Student dashboard with smooth transitions
3. `student/student_login.html` - Login page with entrance animations

All animations maintain the existing design integrity while enhancing the user experience with smooth, professional transitions.
